# Analyzing the Relationship Between Parents' Occupations and Students' Academic Performance

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Simple Correspondence Analysis (SCA) to explore the relationship between the occupations of parents and the academic performance of students in mathematics. The study aims to visualize and interpret how different parental job categories relate to the academic outcomes of students.

## Data Source
The dataset titled "Student Performance in Secondary Education" is used for this analysis and is sourced from Kaggle. It features demographic and academic performance data from 395 students. The dataset can be accessed here: [Kaggle - Student Performance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/student-performance-prediction).

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation:** Initial cleaning and categorization of final grades and parental occupations.
- **Simple Correspondence Analysis:** Application of SCA to examine the associations between parental job categories and student grade categories.
- **Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact Tests:** Statistical tests to verify the independence of the categorical variables.
